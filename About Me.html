	<h3>Welcome to the About Me page. First of all, my name is Teresa. My username is Tersa Bear, I think you can guess why, but I'll tell you anyway. My username is Tersa Bear because I like bears, especially Bear Bear. I'm currently 10 years old, but by the time you see this, I'll probably be older and maybe even making websites, although probably not for stuffed animals. So there you have it, a little bit about me.<h3>
